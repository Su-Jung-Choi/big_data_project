# Data Analytics Project- Traffic Accident Duration Prediction Models

This project was completed during the Fall of 2023 as a final project for a data analytics course. I utilized Azure Databricks to execute the code. To efficiently handle big data, I employed PySpark, the Python API for Spark. Within the 'pyspark.ml' package in PySpark, I implemented three tree-based regression models: Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosted Tree, to predict traffic accident duration. Following is the list of files in this folder:

1. files_split.ipynb : File for splitting the files into chunks; after creating the files, all of them need to be loaded into Databricks.

2. traffic_accident_duration_prediction.ipynb : File that contains all the code and outputs.

3. project_report_sujung_choi.pdf: Final report on the project explaining the process of the project, results, and discussion.
