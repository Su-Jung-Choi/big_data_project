# Data Analytics Project- Traffic Accident Duration Prediction Models

*Dataset Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents

This project was completed during the Fall of 2023 as a final project for a data analytics course. I utilized Azure Databricks to execute the code. To efficiently handle big data, I employed PySpark, the Python API for Spark. Within the 'pyspark.ml' package in PySpark, I implemented three tree-based regression models: Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosted Tree, to predict traffic accident duration.

1. files_split.ipynb : This file is to split the files into chunks; after creating the files, all of them need to be loaded into Databricks.

2. EDA&preprocessing.ipynb : This file contains the outputs of preprocessing and EDA visualization. It is included only to show those output displays.

3. traffic_accident_duration_prediction.ipynb : This file contains all the code and outputs of the rest that are not included in the above file.
